    <h2 id="Ajit_Pai">Who is Ajit V. Pai?</h2>
    <p>Ajit V. Pai is the chairman of the FCC c. January 2017. Appointed by President Trump, Mr. Pai aims to revoke the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf#page=35">Title II</a> classification of ISPs as common carriers and reclassify them as Title I.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Title_II">What is Title II?</h2>
    <p>Title II is part of the Communications Act of 1934. In essence, it prevents service providers from abusing customers.
        <br/>In 2015, an update of the Communications Act of 1934 came into effect, it modernized the literature and reclassified ISPs under Title II.
        This change gives the FCC oversight of ISPs, allowing them to ensure net neutrality (see <a href="#Net_Neutrality">What is Net Neutrality?</a>),
        and even set prices for services provided by ISPs.
