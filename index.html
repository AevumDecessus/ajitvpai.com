    <h2 id="Ajit_Pai">Who is Ajit V. Pai?</h2>
    <p>Ajit V. Pai is the chairman of the FCC c. January 2017.
        Appointed by President Trump, Mr. Pai aims to revoke the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf#page=35">Title II</a> classification of ISPs as common carriers.
        This would mark the end of Net Neutrality as we know it, giving ISPs complete power over the internet - including the ability to outright ban certain websites on their network.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Title_II">What is Title II?</h2>
    <p>Title II is part of the Communications Act of 1934. In essence, it prevents service providers from abusing customers.
        <br/>In 2015, an update of the Communications Act came into effect, it modernized the literature and reclassified ISPs under Title II as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">"common carriers"</a>.
        This change gives the FCC oversight of ISPs, allowing them to ensure net neutrality (see <a href="#Net_Neutrality">What is Net Neutrality?</a>),
        and even set prices for services provided by ISPs.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Net_Neutrality">What is Net Neutrality and the Open Internet?</h2>
    <p>"Net Neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites."</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wikipedia</p>
    
    <h2 id="Implications">What does all of this mean?</h2>
    <p>If Pai's plans come to fruition, ISPs will no longer be regulated by the FCC.
        Instead, it will be up to the FTC to protect consumers (read "EVERYONE", including businesses!)
        from harmful business practices. ISPs have actively fought net neutrality in the past (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#By_issue">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#By_issue</a>),
        and they're certain to continue.</p>
    <p>Without FCC intervention, ISPs can block access to sites, extort companies for
        using more bandwidth than others, and cap and throttle network speeds for users - <i>and they have.</i></p>
    <p><b>We cannot allow this type of behaviour to continue.</b></p>
