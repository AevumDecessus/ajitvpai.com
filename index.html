<h1 id="top">Ajit Varadaraj Pai - (R)uining the Internet as we know it</h1>
    <img src="ajit.png" width="60%" height="auto">
    <h2 id="Ajit_Pai">Who is Ajit V. Pai?</h2>
    <p>Ajit V. Pai is the chairman of the FCC c. January 2017.
        Appointed by President Trump, Mr. Pai aims to revoke the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf#page=35">Title II</a> classification of ISPs as common carriers.
        This would mark the end of Net Neutrality as we know it, giving Internet Service Providers (ISPs) complete power over the internet - including the ability to outright ban certain websites on their network.</p>
    <p>Ajit has spent several years as a lawyer for Verizon, and is seen more as an "ally to broadcasters" (television) than to the FCC.</p>
    
    <h2>What are his intentions?</h2>
    <p>His intentions are simple: To make more money for existing monopolies/duopolies that control the United States.
        Here's what ISPs can do without the restrictions currently in place: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create "Internet Highways" - that is to say, <b>extort companies for more bandwidth <a href="#ex_1">on top of paying for bandwidth in their plan.</a></b></li>
        <li>Create website packages - without Net Neutrality we may have to <b>pay to access certain websites and services. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/6d957x/website_packages_from_your_isp_its_coming/">Imagine that.</a></b></li>
        <li><b>And more...</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>His intentions are purely monetary. In fact, Ajit Pai removed the site for sending comments to the FCC: 
        (previously https://www.fcc.gov/general/send-us-your-comments, this is still the top result on <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=send+a+comment+to+the+fcc&t=ffab&ia=web">Duck Duck Go</a>). 
        Now commenting is obscured and more difficult: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-comment#comments.
    
    <h2 id="Title_II">What is Title II?</h2>
    <p>Title II is part of the Communications Act of 1934. In essence, it prevents service providers from abusing customers.
        <br/>In 2015, an update of the Communications Act came into effect, it modernized the literature and reclassified ISPs under Title II as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">"common carriers"</a>.
        This change gives the FCC oversight of ISPs, allowing them to ensure net neutrality (see <a href="#Net_Neutrality">What is Net Neutrality?</a>),
        and even set prices for services provided by ISPs.</p>
    
    <h2 id="Net_Neutrality">What is Net Neutrality and the Open Internet?</h2>
    <p>"Net Neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites."</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Wikipedia</p>
    
    <h2 id="Implications">What does all of this mean?</h2>
    <p>If Pai's plans come to fruition, ISPs will no longer be regulated by the FCC.
        Instead, it will be up to the FTC to protect consumers (read "EVERYONE", including businesses!)
        from harmful business practices. ISPs have actively fought net neutrality in the past (
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#By_issue">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#By_issue</a>),
        and they're certain to continue.</p>
    <p>Without FCC intervention, ISPs can block access to sites, extort companies for
        using more bandwidth than others, and cap and throttle network speeds for users - <i>and they have.</i></p>
    <p><b>We cannot allow this type of behaviour to continue.</b></p>
    
    <h2>Potential Problems with removing Net Neutrality</h2>
    <h3 id="ex_1">Extortion of Businesses</h3>
    <p>An up and coming streaming service, "webflicks", sweeps the nation.
        They use a lot of bandwidth, and pay for that bandwidth accordingly.
        A large ISP, "Corncats", refuses to update their infrastructure and in turn can't handle all this new traffic.
        So, despite paying for a certain bandwidth, webflicks still isn't getting 100% out of it. 
        The average speed for consumers in the area drops down to 1Mbps. Yikes.
        Corncats decides to strike a deal with webflicks.
        If webflicks pays Corncats, the ISP will increase the bandwidth going to the webflicks website.
        Simultaneously, this slows down all other traffic going through Corncats infrastructure.
        <br/> Sounds bad right? Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#Peering_discrimination">This has already happened</a></b>.
